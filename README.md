# GAP Package: Subindex and Subfactors of Groups

This is a simple GAP Package designed to assist the study of subindex and subfactors in finite groups, as initially presented in the following paper:

- [Index, sub-index and sub-factor of groups with interactions to number theory](https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219498820501017)

The package has been developed with the specific goal of providing tools and solutions for addressing the questions posed in the mentioned paper, as well as in :
- [Subindices and subfactors of finite groups](https://doi.org/10.1080/00927872.2023.2168685)

This package has been used for the complete characterization of finite index stable groups.
